# Keep AGENTS.md Up to Date

When making major changes that affect any of the following, update `AGENTS.md` in the same session:

- **Tech stack**: Adding, removing, or upgrading dependencies
- **Project structure**: New directories, layout hierarchy, or significant file moves
- **Routing/content**: New content types, routing patterns, or frontmatter conventions
- **Styling**: Tailwind config changes, new design tokens, or styling approach
- **Scripts**: New or changed npm scripts
- **Build/deploy**: Config changes (e.g. Astro, redirects, hosting)

Apply the same conventions used in `AGENTS.md`: concise tables, bullet lists, and clear section headings. Do not leave the project with outdated documentation.
