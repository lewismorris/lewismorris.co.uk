I’ve been trying to get back into photography over the past year, and when I say “back into” I mean actually using a camera (that isn’t my iPhone) in a mode other than auto.

The process of composing photos, looking for leading lines and chasing the light has got me thinking more about the stories behind photos, and how I can tell my own. It feels like a skill we’ve all lost a bit over the past couple of years with the rise of generative AI for images and video. You type the prompt, you get the output, job done and onto the next one.

But that isn’t telling a story. Sure, your AI photo might look great (because it has plagiarised the work of others for free), but it is cold and emotionless and it isn’t real. When I look at a photo, I want the story behind it. I want to know that you got up early to catch the sunrise, or stood in the pouring rain for hours waiting for the right moment.

When I was a kid we had the infamous lighthouse photo ["La Jument" by Jean Guichard](https://medium.com/the-shortform/the-scary-story-behind-the-worlds-most-famous-lighthouse-in-the-storm-picture-0cb1c9d14f93) on a wall at home. I stared at it for years wondering how it happened and what the story was. Was he trying to rescue the keeper in the photo, or was it simply a perfect photo opportunity? To me, that photo is the perfect example of storytelling through an image and how your brain kicks into overdrive trying to understand the how, what and why.

But I digress. I’m not a professional photographer. Photographer maybe, professional no. This isn’t a post about becoming one. I do think the same idea applies elsewhere though, whether it is marketing, coding or design. We are seeing more and more of it generated by AI, and for the most part I am here for it.

What I hate is how quickly the creative parts of our lives are being down-valued, while I am still stood washing dishes or loading the washing machine. Use AI to automate the boring bits, the boilerplate code, the quick proof read. But do not hand over the thing that feeds your brain. Your creativity. You can be creative with code, words, photos, design, anything at all.

Harness the creativity you already have, start making things that matter, and most of all remember to use your brain and tell a story.

This post is part rant and part attempt to share a bit of wisdom. Hopefully it has done something and you have not taken offence. It was partly inspired by [James Popsys](https://www.youtube.com/@JamesPopsysPhoto), who is a brilliant photographer, YouTuber and storyteller, and the book *Steal Like an Artist* by [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/) , as I have probably stolen a bit of influence from both to write this.
